🚀 Getting Started with Create React App...
This project was bootstrapped using Create React App using Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, and Node.js

📦 Available Scripts
Inside the project directory, you can run the following commands:

🔧 `npm start`
Starts the app in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically when you make edits.

Console will show any lint errors or warnings.

🧪 `npm test`
Launches the test runner in watch mode.

Ideal for running unit and component tests during development.

🏗️ `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.

React is optimized and bundled in production mode.

Filenames include content hashes for better caching.

The resulting app is ready for deployment.

⚠️ npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation — once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you want full control over the configuration (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), you can eject.

This command will copy all config files and dependencies into your project.

Useful for advanced customization, but not required for most projects.

💡 Tips
Most projects don’t need to eject. The default setup is powerful enough for small to medium apps.
