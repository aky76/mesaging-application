  The manifest.json file contains metadata that defines how your web app appears
  when installed on a user's mobile device or desktop (as a Progressive Web App).

  It includes information like the app name, icons, theme color, and display mode. -->

    <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
    <!--
      
  Note the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
  This placeholder is automatically replaced with the correct URL path to the `public` folder during the build process.

  Only assets placed inside the `public` directory can be directly referenced in this HTML file.

  Using "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" ensures that your assets load correctly,
  even when your app is deployed under a subdirectory or uses client-side routing.

  To learn how to set a custom base path (non-root URL), run `npm run build` and follow the Create React App deployment guide.

  This HTML file serves as the main template for your React application.
  
  If opened directly in the browser, it will appear blank â€” the actual UI is injected via JavaScript.

  You may customize this file by adding web fonts, meta tags, favicons, analytics, or other head elements.

  During the build process, the bundled React scripts will be automatically inserted into the <body> tag.

  To start the development server, use: `npm start` or `yarn start`.
  To generate an optimized production build, use: `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
